// We know that to pull off this caper Carmen will be wearing a disguise, we need to figure out what she will look like in order to nab her for sure this time.

// We found a partial receipt we think was for a disguise. However, we only have the price of the item, not the name, and we only have the after tax price. We need to take all items from the store, and add tax to them to see if we find a match.

// 1. Write a function that will take in an array of prices and a tax rate, and return an array of those prices after the tax has been added. (Hint: use the map method)
// Example:
// Input: [10, 15, 20], 0.05
// Output: [10.5, 15.75, 21]

function afterTax(arr, tax) {
  // TODO YOUR CODE HERE
}

// ---------------------------------------------

// 2. Write a function that will take in an array of arrays and return an array of objects where the first property is the "name", and the second property is the "price".
// Example:
// Input: [["Cowboy", 10], ["Nun", 15], ["Scarecrow", 20]]
// Output: [{name: "Cowboy", price: 10}, {name: "Nun", price: 15}, {name: "Scarecrow", price: 20}]

function convertToObjects(arr) {
  // TODO YOUR CODE HERE
}

// ---------------------------------------------

// 3. Write a function that will join two arrays together. (Hint: use the concat method or the spread operator)
// Example:
// Input: [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]
// Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

function joinArrays(arr1, arr2) {
  // TODO YOUR CODE HERE
}

// ---------------------------------------------

// 4. Write a function that will take in an array of items and return the total of their prices. (Hint: use the reduce method)
// Example:
// Input: [{name: "Cowboy", price: 10}, {name: "Nun", price: 15}, {name: "Scarecrow", price: 20}]
// Output: 35

function totalReceipt(arr) {
  // TODO YOUR CODE HERE
}

// ---------------------------------------------

// 5. Write a function that will convert an array of objects into a dictionary. Where the key is the name of the item and the value is the price.
// Example:
// Input: [{name: "Cowboy", price: 10}, {name: "Nun", price: 15}, {name: "Scarecrow", price: 20}]
// Output: {Cowboy: 10, Nun: 15, Scarecrow: 20}

function convertToDictionary(arr) {
  // TODO YOUR CODE HERE
}
